<h1>Reservations CMS</h1>

<br/>

Reservation CMS is a project to create a booking like reservations system for a single accomodation facilities. A client may check availablity of rooms, choose and ask for a reservation. Then a manager can check reservation in admin panel and carry on process. As a CMS was used the [Sulu](https://sulu.io/), which is a highly extensible open-source **PHP content management system based** on the [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) framework. Sulu is developed to deliver robust **multi-lingual and multi-portal websites** while providing an **intuitive and extensible administration interface** to manage the full content lifecycle.
